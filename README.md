This site was fully coded by Meera Bhola. It is meant to showcase skills and serve as part of a beginner portfolio. This website features Boostrap CSS, HTML, and Phaser.JS.
The website is themed in Gotham City and features key players from the Batman series--both allies and foes. There is a lot of attention to the color theme and color palette of this website.
When making this project, some of the biggest poblems I faced were laying everything out correctly and making sure the game functions as I wanted it to.
